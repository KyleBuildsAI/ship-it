# LEARNING

Every PR in this repo ends with three "can you answer these?" questions. They are collected here, newest last, so you can study them later. Try to answer each one out loud before you open the answers, then read the PR's "Concepts" section if you missed one.

## #14 chore: project tooling and HUD shell

https://github.com/KyleBuildsAI/ship-it/pull/14

1. Why does `vite.config.ts` use `/ship-it/` for build and preview but `/` for dev? What would you see on the Pages site if the base were wrong?
2. `npm run check` chains its steps with `&&`. What happens if lint fails? Why is that order (lint and format first, build last) a sensible one?
3. Name one bug that type-aware linting catches but `tsc` alone lets through, and explain why it's dangerous in a game that has to `await renderer.init()`.

<details><summary>Answers</summary>

1. GitHub Pages serves this repo under the `/ship-it/` path, so the built `index.html` has to request `/ship-it/assets/...`. With the wrong base, the HTML loads but every script and stylesheet 404s, and you get a blank page. `vite preview` serves that same build, so it needs the same base. Dev uses `/` so you can just open `localhost:5173`.
2. `&&` only runs the next command if the previous one succeeded, so a lint failure stops everything and the whole command reports failure. The cheap, fast checks go first so you learn about a problem in seconds instead of after a full build.
3. A floating Promise: calling an async function without `await` or `.catch()`. It compiles fine, but errors inside disappear silently and later code runs before the work finishes. An un-awaited `renderer.init()` can render a frame before the GPU device exists. `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` flags it.
